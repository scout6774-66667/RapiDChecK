## What This App Does

RuralHealth AI is an AI-powered early disease risk prediction and rural health access platform, designed for use by ASHA/ANM health workers, PHC doctors, rural patients, and district health officers in India.

It enables a complete screening workflow:

**PATIENT REGISTRATION -> HEALTH ASSESSMENT -> AI SCREENING -> EXPLAINABLE RESULT -> SAVE -> PHC DASHBOARD**

---

## Implemented Features

### Phase 1 - P0 Core MVP (COMPLETE)

#### 1. Patient Registration
- Mobile-first registration form
- Fields: Full Name, Age, Gender, Village, Phone Number, Patient ID (optional)
- Required field validation with inline error messages (name, age, gender, village)
- Patient record stored in SQLite (online) or IndexedDB (offline)

#### 2. Health Assessment (3-Step Wizard)
- Step 1: Patient registration
- Step 2: Health data collection
  - 12 touch-friendly symptom pill selectors: Fever, Cough, Fatigue, Headache, Dizziness, Shortness of Breath, Chest Discomfort, Frequent Urination, Increased Thirst, Weakness, Swelling, Nausea
  - Vitals: Temperature (F), Systolic BP, Diastolic BP, Heart Rate, Blood Glucose (mg/dL), Height (cm), Weight (kg)
  - Auto-calculated BMI from height and weight
  - Lifestyle: Smoking status, Alcohol use, Physical Activity level
  - Family History: multi-select condition checkboxes
  - Symptom Duration (days)
  - Voice input via Web Speech API for any field
- Step 3: Screening result

#### 3. AI Screening Engine
- Deterministic, transparent, rule-based clinical decision-support engine
- Evaluates: age, symptoms, vitals, BMI, lifestyle, family history, symptom duration
- Outputs:
  - Risk Level: LOW / MODERATE / HIGH
  - Risk Score: 0-100%
  - Likely Conditions (non-diagnostic wording only)
  - Contributing Factors (explainability)
  - Recommended Next Action
- Clinical domains assessed:
  - Diabetes risk (glucose, BMI, age, family history, urinary symptoms)
  - Hypertension/Cardiovascular risk (BP thresholds, age, smoking)
  - TB/Respiratory risk (cough duration, fever, SOB, weight loss)
  - General/Anemia risk (weakness, fatigue, demographics)
- Never claims clinical diagnosis. Uses language like:
  - "Elevated Diabetes Screening Risk - Further Evaluation Recommended"
  - "Possible Hypertension-Related Concern"
  - "Elevated TB Screening Concern - Sputum Smear Recommended"

#### 4. Real ML Disease Classifier (Phase 2 — COMPLETE)

> **Separate from the risk engine** — the ML model is a symptom-based disease classifier, not a vitals triage system.

**Dataset:** `dhivyeshrk/diseases-and-symptoms-dataset` (Kaggle)
- 246,945 rows × 377 binary symptom features × 773 disease classes
- Deduplicated: 57,298 duplicate rows removed → 189,647 clean rows
- 49 zero-variance features removed → 328 remaining features
- Class filtering: only 512 classes with ≥ 20 samples retained (practical model)

**Training Pipeline** (`backend/ml/train_model.py`):
- Stratified split: 70% Train / 15% Val / 15% Test (random_state=42)
- Primary: **Logistic Regression** (L-BFGS, class_weight='balanced', max_iter=200)
- Baseline: **Random Forest** (n_estimators=50, max_depth=15) for comparison

**Model Evaluation Results:**

| Metric | Logistic Regression ✅ (selected) | Random Forest |
|---|---|---|
| Test Accuracy | 0.8399 | 0.4436 |
| **Top-3 Accuracy** | **0.9524** | 0.5494 |
| Macro F1 | 0.7982 | 0.5101 |
| Weighted F1 | 0.8460 | 0.5076 |

**Explainability:** For each predicted class, model contributing features are derived from Logistic Regression coefficients intersected with input symptoms. NOT clinical causal explanations.

**Prediction Service** (`backend/ml/predictor.py`):
- Loaded once at backend startup (`disease_predictor = DiseasePredictor()`)
- `predict_disease(symptoms: list[str])` → Top-3 predictions with scores + contributing features
- Unknown symptoms silently dropped; gracefully returns empty if all unknown

**API Endpoint** `POST /api/ml/predict`:
- Input: `{ "symptoms": ["fever", "cough", "fatigue"] }`
- Output: Top-3 predictions with condition name, model score, contributing symptom features
- HTTP 400 for empty list or all-unknown symptoms
- HTTP 503 if model not loaded (run train_model.py first)

**Frontend Integration:**
- `AshaScreeningFlow.tsx` calls `/api/ml/predict` when user clicks "Analyze"
- Step 3 result screen shows real Top-3 ML conditions with scores and model contributing features
- Falls back to risk engine's likely_conditions if ML endpoint unavailable


#### 4. Explainability
- Every screening result includes human-readable contributing factors
- Examples: "Blood Glucose >= 200 mg/dL", "Persistent Cough > 14 days", "Stage 2 Blood Pressure"
- Color-coded risk badge (green/amber/red)
- Structured recommendation for ASHA worker or PHC doctor

#### 5. Medical Safety Disclaimer
- Prominent disclaimer displayed on every screening result:
  "This tool is a screening and decision-support prototype. It does not provide a medical diagnosis and does not replace evaluation by a qualified healthcare professional."
- No medicine prescription logic

#### 6. Patient Record Persistence
- Full assessment record saved with:
  - Patient info, symptoms, vitals, lifestyle, family history, BMI
  - Screening score, risk level, likely conditions, contributing factors
  - Timestamp, referral status
- Survives browser page refresh (IndexedDB + SQLite)

#### 7. PHC Dashboard
- Live metrics from actual patient data (not hardcoded):
  - Total Patients
  - Today's Assessments
  - High-Risk Patients
  - Pending Referrals
- Risk Distribution chart (Recharts - LOW/MODERATE/HIGH breakdown)
- High-Risk Priority Queue table with columns: Patient | Village | Risk | Concern | Referral Status | Action
- Inline "Mark as Referred" action per patient row
- Updates dynamically when new assessments are saved

#### 8. Patient Directory
- Searchable list of all registered patients
- Filter by name or village
- Click any patient to view full assessment history modal

#### 9. Navigation
- Prominent "+ New Assessment" CTA button (always visible in header)
- Tab navigation: Dashboard | Patients | High-Risk Cases
- Clicking "High-Risk Cases" tab filters directly to high-risk patients

#### 10. Offline-First Architecture
- All writes go to browser IndexedDB immediately (works without internet)
- Offline risk calculator mirrors server engine for fallback screening
- On network reconnect: auto-syncs pending records via POST /api/sync
- Online/Offline status pill always visible in header
- **Online detection (fixed)**: Dual-signal system in App.tsx:
  - `window` `online`/`offline` browser events catch real network drops
  - 5-second heartbeat pings `/api/health` — pill turns red if the **local backend** goes down (not just internet)
  - `isOnline` becomes `false` if EITHER signal fails; auto-sync + toast fires on reconnect


#### 11. Multilingual Support
- UI strings available in: English, Hindi (हिंदी), Bengali (বাংলা)
- Language selector in header - switches app-wide instantly

#### 12. Voice Input (Online + Offline)
- **Online mode**: Web Speech API (webkitSpeechRecognition) — microphone button transcribes speech in English, Hindi (hi-IN), or Bengali (bn-IN). Transcript appended to symptoms field.
- **Offline mode**: Automatically switches to an inline keyboard-input panel (amber UI). ASHA worker types symptoms and presses Add (or Ctrl+Enter). Text is appended identically to voice mode.
- Root cause: Web Speech API sends audio to Google cloud servers and REQUIRES internet — offline keyboard panel is the graceful degradation.
- Localised in all 3 languages (EN/HI/BN)

#### 13. AI Health Assistant Chatbot (OpenAI GPT-4o mini)
- Floating chat widget accessible across all views
- Powered by OpenAI GPT-4o mini via backend endpoint `POST /api/chat` (API key stored securely in backend `.env`)
- Answers symptom queries (e.g. fever, cough, blood sugar, high BP) with actionable guidance and home care tips
- Enforces strict rural health guardrails: no medicine prescriptions, mandatory PHC/doctor referral warnings, emergency 108 alerts for critical symptoms
- Supports multilingual interaction in English, Hindi, and Bengali with one-click suggestion pills

#### 14. Teleconsultation Booking Module (Dual-Map Engine)
- Integrated hospital finder using a robust fallback map engine.
- **Google Maps**: Loads first if an API key is provided, fetching real nearby hospitals and rendering interactive map markers.
- **OpenStreetMap + Nominatim Fallback**: Seamlessly switches to free OSS maps if Google Maps fails or the API key is missing.
- **Manual Location Search**: Allows ASHA workers to manually type a village/city and geocodes it dynamically.
- **Two-Way Interaction**: Clicking a hospital in the list pans the map and bounces the marker; clicking a marker highlights the hospital in the list.

#### 15. Dynamic Interactive Mascot
- A cute, flat-vector Doctor Mascot that follows the user throughout the screening workflow.
- Dynamically changes poses based on context:
  - Step 1: Holding a pointer stick ("Please fill the form!")
  - Step 2: Holding a notepad ("I'm noting symptoms...")
  - Step 3: Reacting to the risk score (Thumbs up for Low Risk, Thinking for Moderate Risk, Shocked/Urgent for High Risk).

#### 16. Medical Cursor Animation
- A highly unique, global HTML5 Canvas overlay.
- Leaves a beautiful, fading trail of red hearts and blue medical crosses as the user moves their mouse.
- Completely non-intrusive (pointer-events-none) and highly engaging.
