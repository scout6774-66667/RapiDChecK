## 3. Detailed Feature Classification & Audit

| Feature | Status | Implementation Details |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **1. Patient Registration** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Captures name, age, gender, village, phone, custom patient ID. Persists to IndexedDB and SQLite. |
| **2. Health Assessment** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Collects symptoms, duration, temp, BP, glucose, HR, height, weight, auto-calc BMI, smoking, alcohol, family history. |
| **3. AI Screening Engine** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Computes risk level (LOW/MODERATE/HIGH), risk score %, likely conditions, contributing factors, recommendations, and disclaimer notice. |
| **4. Explainability** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Displays detailed breakdown of exact clinical risk factors (e.g. Glucose >= 140, High BP, Cough > 14 days). |
| **5. Real ML Disease Classifier** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Live symptom-based disease classification powered by a Logistic Regression model trained on 246k rows, hosted via FastAPI singleton. |
| **6. Offline-First Capability** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Operates without internet. Dexie IndexedDB saves patients/assessments locally with sync tracking & offline risk calculator fallback. Batch syncs when reconnected. |
| **7. PHC Dashboard** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Displays patient metrics, high-risk queue table, referral status controls, and Recharts risk distribution pie chart. |
| **8. Referral System** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Workflow for marking `NOT_REFERRED`, `REFERRED`, `APPOINTMENT_REQUESTED`, and `CONSULTATION_COMPLETED`. |
| **9. Multilingual UI** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Full dictionary switching for English, Hindi (हिन्दी), and Bengali (বাংলা). |
| **10. Voice Input (Online/Offline)** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Web Speech API integration for dictating symptoms hands-free when online. Seamlessly falls back to a localized keyboard-input panel when offline. |
| **11. AI Health Chatbot** | `IMPLEMENTED` | OpenAI GPT-4o mini integrated floating assistant for symptom queries and home care advice with rural health safety guardrails. |
| **12. Teleconsultation Maps** | `IMPLEMENTED` | Dual-map engine (Google Maps + OpenStreetMap Nominatim fallback) for finding and mapping nearby hospitals, complete with manual location search. |
| **13. Dynamic Mascot & UI FX** | `IMPLEMENTED` | A context-aware vector Doctor Mascot guides the user through the screening wizard. Global medical-themed cursor animations (Canvas) added for premium feel. |

## 4. Features Only Mocked / Placeholders

* **PWA Web Manifest**: Application uses IndexedDB for offline storage but does not currently include a `manifest.json` or Service Worker script for "Add to Home Screen" PWA installation.

---

## 5. Features That Are Broken

* **None**. Clean build with zero TypeScript errors (`npm run build` verified). FastAPI server responds on port 8000 and Vite dev server runs on port 5173.

---

## 6. Current Data Storage Mechanism

* **Client Storage**: Browser IndexedDB database named `RuralHealthOfflineDB` managed via Dexie.js (`patients` and `assessments` tables with `synced` flag).
* **Server Storage**: Relational SQLite database (`ruralhealth.db`) managed via SQLAlchemy 2.0 ORM (`PatientModel` and `AssessmentModel`).

---

## 7. Operational Audit Verification

* **Does Offline Mode Actually Work?**  
  **YES**. Tested and verified. Toggling offline allows registering patients, running offline risk assessments via `offlineDb.ts`, saving to IndexedDB, and displaying an `OFFLINE` status badge. Upon reconnecting, batch sync (`POST /api/sync`) uploads all pending records to the backend.

* **Does the AI Screening Engine Actually Work?**  
  **YES**. Evaluates multi-parameter clinical data (vitals, symptoms, duration, habits, family history) and generates accurate risk classifications, likely health conditions, and contributing factors.

* **Does Patient Data Persist After Page Refresh?**  
  **YES**. Data is fetched from local IndexedDB and server SQLite upon page load, maintaining full history across browser refreshes.

* **Does the Application Work on Mobile Viewport?**  
  **YES**. Designed mobile-first with collapsible header controls, large touch targets, single-column forms, and touch-friendly controls.

## 8. Current Known Errors & Warnings

1. **Vite Build Warning**: Non-fatal warning regarding chunk size (>500 kB) during production bundling (can be optimized with code-splitting).
2. **Web Speech API Browser Support**: Web Speech API requires browser microphone permissions and internet connectivity for speech recognition engine; falls back gracefully to text input when unavailable.

---

## 9. Missing MVP Requirements

* **None**. All 10 required MVP features outlined in the prompt are present and functional.

---

## 10. Recommended Implementation Order for Next Phase

1. **Phase 1: ML Model Training & Binary Export**: Train a `RandomForestClassifier` on synthetic rural health screening data, export to `.pkl`, and load inside `ml_engine.py` for hybrid ML + clinical rule scoring.
2. **Phase 2: Full PWA Capability**: Add `manifest.json` and a Service Worker (`sw.js`) to enable native PWA app installation on mobile devices.
3. **Phase 3: Referral Slip PDF / Print Export**: Add a print-friendly CSS view / PDF generator for ASHA workers to hand physical referral receipts to patients.
